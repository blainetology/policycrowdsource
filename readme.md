# Purpose

Policy Crowdsource is meant to be a platform for sharing and building laws/policies/bills/guidelines/etc. It is built around the idea that every section of a proposed bill can be rated individually, showing which pieces of the bill have bipartisan support. 

Rather than dumping a bill entirely because it has no bipartisan support, instead we can start with the common ground that everyone agrees with and build from there. Basically, this is meant to be my fix-the-world project, like change.org is.

## Packages

Laravel 5.4, Bootstrap 3.x
